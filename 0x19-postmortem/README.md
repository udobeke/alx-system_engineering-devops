# Post-Mortem Writing Task #
This task is designed to test your ability to write a post-mortem report for a web stack debugging project issue or an outage. You'll be expected to write a concise summary of the issue, a detailed timeline of events, an explanation of the root cause and resolution, and a list of corrective and preventative measures to prevent similar issues in the future.
## Overview ##
Any software system will eventually fail, and that failure can come stem from a wide range of possible factors: bugs, traffic spikes, security issues, hardware failures, natural disasters, human error… Failing is normal and failing is actually a great opportunity to learn and improve. Any great Software Engineer must learn from his/her mistakes to make sure that they won’t happen again. Failing is fine, but failing twice because of the same issue is not.

A postmortem is a tool widely used in the tech industry. After any outage, the team(s) in charge of the system will write a summary that has 2 main goals:

To provide the rest of the company’s employees easy access to information detailing the cause of the outage. Often outages can have a huge impact on a company, so managers and executives have to understand what happened and how it will impact their work.
And to ensure that the root cause(s) of the outage has been discovered and that measures are taken to make sure it will be fixed.


## Instructions ##
You'll need to use your creativity to invent your own outage scenario or use a real-world example if you've experienced one before. Your post-mortem report should be between 400 to 600 words and follow the format provided in the task description.

Be sure to include a catchy title, a humorous or attention-grabbing summary, and any additional graphics or diagrams to make your report stand out.
